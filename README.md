## Getting Started

### Step 1: Team Organization
- Assign a team member as the **Product Manager (PM)** for Nara.
- Ensure this PM is different from the one assigned to the Lunch Lotto project.

### Step 2: Repository Setup
The PM should fork the repository:
1. Navigate to the `nara-extension-starter` repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy under their account.

### Step 3: Cloning the Repository
Once the PM has forked the repository, team members should clone it locally:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<PM-username>/nara-extension-starter.git
```

### Step 4: Development Workflow
1. Open the project in a text editor (e.g., **Visual Studio Code** recommended).
2. Make changes to the codebase.
3. Use the following commands to commit and push your changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [feature name] added"
git push
```

4. As team members contribute, collaborate using **Pull Requests (PRs)** on GitHub.
5. Regularly sync your local repository with the latest changes:

```sh
git pull
```

6. Resolve merge conflicts as needed and ensure smooth integration.

## Submission
- Submit the final version of your project as per course guidelines.
- Include a brief write-up of your implemented features and any challenges faced.
